# Connect Four AI

## Introduction

Connect Four is a two-player strategy game played on a 6×7 grid where players take turns dropping colored discs into columns. A player wins by placing four of the same colored pieces in a row: horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

This project implements Connect Four with an AI opponent that you can play against.

## How to Play the Game

1. After downloading the code from GitHub, run the following command in your terminal:
   ```bash
   python3 gui.py
   ```
2. A graphical window will appear on your screen.
3. The game is turn-based, with the user (you) taking the first move.
4. To place a tile, click on the column where you want the tile to drop.
5. Turns alternate between the user and the AI agent until a winner is determined or the board is full.
